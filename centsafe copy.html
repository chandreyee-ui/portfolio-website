                            Centsafe was developed during my CareerFoundry course to address the challenge of quickly
                            saving money for a specific goal. Targeted at users familiar with technology but uncomfortable
                            managing finances, the goal was to simplify saving while boosting user confidence and control.

                    <h2>Research:</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first step was diving into competitive analysis, exploring existing financial apps like Mint,
                        YNAB, and Qapital. I wanted to understand what these apps were doing right, and more
                        importantly, where they were falling short in helping users save for specific goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I conducted user interviews to uncover the pain points that people experience when trying to
                        save money. The insights were eye-opening—many users felt overwhelmed by financial jargon and
                        frustrated by the lack of personalized guidance.

            <div class="row userstories-and-flowdevelopment-card">
                <h3>User Stories and Flow Development:</h3>
                <p>
                    From these insights, I developed user stories that captured the essential features Centsafe
                    neededto have. For example, one user story focused on the ability to set up an autosave feature that
                    would automatically transfer a set amount of money into savings on a regular basis. This feature was
                    crucial for users who wanted to save consistently without the hassle of manual transfers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then created a user flow diagram, mapping out the key interactions within the app. This step
                    wasvital in ensuring that users could navigate Centsafe effortlessly, from setting up their profile
                    to tracking their savings progress.

                        With the foundation laid, I moved on to wireframing. The low-fidelity wireframes helped me
                        sketch out the basic structure and functionality of the app, focusing on user experience and ease of
                        use. As I progressed to mid- and high-fidelity wireframes, I began refining the visual design. My
                        goal was to create an interface that was not only intuitive but also visually appealing, with a
                        calming color palette and clear, readable typography that made financial data easy to digest.

                                also includes the Auto-Save feature, and suggested autosave options.

                    <h3>Testing and iterating:</h3>
                    <p>
                        User testing was a critical phase. I conducted sessions with a diverse group of users to
                        gather feedback on both the design and functionality. One key finding was the importance of
                        making the autosave setup process as simple and transparent as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the feedback, I iterated on the design, enhancing the clarity of the autosave
                        feature, adding a “How it works” section and improving the overall user experience. These
                        iterations were essential in fine-tuning the app to meet the needs of its users.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most significant challenges in designing Centsafe was striking the right
                        balance between simplicity and functionality. Users needed a tool that was powerful enough to
                        manage their finances but simple enough to use without frustration. The autosave feature, in
                        particular, required careful consideration—users had to feel comfortable setting up
                        automatedsavings without worrying about overcommitting. To address this, I focused on providing
                        clear, step-by-step instructions and options to pause or adjust the autosave settings, ensuring
                        flexibility and control.

                <h3>What Went Well:</h3>
                <p>
                    The development of Centsafe successfully translated user needs into a streamlined,
                    user-friendly financial tool. The clean design, combined with intuitive features like Auto-Save,
                    received positive feedback for its simplicity and effectiveness in helping users reach their
                    savings goals.
                </p>
                <h3>What Didn't Go Well:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the early stages, balancing the app's simplicity with the inclusion of advanced
                    features proved difficult. Some initial designs were too complex for the target audience,
                    requiring multiple revisions to achieve the right level of clarity and accessibility.
                    Additionally, the time constraints limited the depth of analytics and educational features that could be
                    implemented.

                    <h3>Key Learnings:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The key takeaway for me was- designing for simplicity without sacrificing functionality
                        is crucial, especially for users who may be less familiar with financial tools. I learned
                        that iterative testing and user feedback are essential to refining the user experience and
                        ensuring the app meets users' needs. Additionally, clear communication of financial concepts
                        through intuitive design is vital in building user confidence and trust.
                    </p>
                    <h3>If I Had More Time:</h3>
                    <p>
                        If I were to revisit this project, I would explore ways to enhance the app’s educational
                        aspects, perhaps by incorporating more interactive elements that explain financial
                        concepts in simple terms. Additionally, I see potential in expanding the app’s analytics features to
                        offer predictive insights, helping users anticipate financial trends and adjust their savings
                        strategies accordingly.
